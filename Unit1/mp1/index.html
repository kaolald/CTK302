    <h1>Agent Monochrome and the Rainbow Butterfly</h1>
    <p>Agent Monochrome is a detective in a dark and gloomy city, where no color seems to show besides black, white, or grey. One day, investigating a case one rainy night he saw a strange creature that looked like a butterfly. <br> It flew around for a while and landed, but when lightning struck the building beside the butterfly, it rapidly changed colors. Turning the right, Agent Monochrome found a piece of evidence that would prove crucial to the case. <br> Agent Monochrome and the butterfly would continue to meet at various cases, always turning up when evidence is near.</p>
